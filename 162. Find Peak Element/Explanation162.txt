This problem is similar to Local Minimum. And according to the given condition, num[i] != num[i+1], there must exist a O(logN) solution. So we use binary search for this problem.

If num[i-1] < num[i] > num[i+1], then num[i] is peak
If num[i-1] < num[i] < num[i+1], then num[i+1...n-1] must contains a peak
If num[i-1] > num[i] > num[i+1], then num[0...i-1] must contains a peak
If num[i-1] > num[i] < num[i+1], then both sides have peak
(n is num.length)
