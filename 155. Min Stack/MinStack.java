/*
Constant runtime, O(n) space â€“ Extra stack:

Use an extra stack to keep track of the current minimum value. During the push 
operation we choose the new element or the current minimum, whichever that is 
smaller to push onto the min stack. 

Minor space optimization:

If a new element is larger than the current minimum, we do not need to push it 
on to the min stack. When we perform the pop operation, check if the popped element 
is the same as the current minimum. If it is, pop it off the min stack too.
